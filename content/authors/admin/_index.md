Hanqiu Chen is a senior student from elite program in School of Physics at Nanjing University. I am applying for a PhD program in ECE for 2022 semester. My research interests include software-hardware co-design: hardware-efficient machine learning, on-device AI; high-performance reconfigurable computing: FPGA, embedded system, IoT, edge computing; neuromorphic computing systems. I am now working with Prof. Callie Hao in Department of ECE at Georgia Tech as a research intern to study AI hardware accelerators on FPGA.
